                        first and last name, an email address, a phone number, a home or other physical address, and
                        other contact information. In addition, in some jurisdictions (as the EU, for example), and

                    and prevent fraud or any automated non-human actions across our Websites and Services. The IP
                    address also serves our legitimate interest to learn the country from which you access the

                    of ensuring that the device and installation are real and not fraudulent and to ensure that the

                    <li>If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by email. Any
